This package does not provide a keyboard shortcut by default, but you can easily [define your own][atom-keymaps]. For example, if you wanted to use `Control-D` (as shown in the demo above), you'd add the following mapping to your `~/.atom/keymap.cson` file:\n\n```cson\n'atom-workspace atom-text-editor:not(.mini)':\n  'ctrl-d': 'toggle-markdown-task:toggle'\n```\n\n## TODO\n\n- [ ] Set up CI\n\n[atom-keymaps]: https://atom.io/docs/v1.0.15/using-atom-basic-customization#customizing-key-bindings\n[gfm-task-lists]: https://help.github.com/articles/writing-on-github/#task-lists\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/jasonrudolph/toggle-markdown-task/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/jasonrudolph/toggle-markdown-task#readme","_id":"toggle-markdown-task@0.6.0","_shasum":"2d0fb6fb37bf76fbad6f196168209f92dc70cb62","_resolved":"file:../d-117224-52935-5ebwp0/package.tgz","_from":"../d-117224-52935-5ebwp0/package.tgz"}
